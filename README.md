# Line-Stoppage-Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a strong predictive model that can foresee potential issues in the tractor engine assembly process in the future. The program seeks to offer precise predictions of future failures ahead of time by examining historical data on tractor engine problems and their underlying causes. This proactive strategy will greatly speed up manufacturing, reduce unplanned downtime, and guarantee consistently reliable, high-quality tractor engines. The prediction model will be based on sizable datasets that are fully informed about prior tractor engine failures and the underlying causes of these problems. The model will use machine learning techniques to draw out significant patterns and insights from this data, enabling it to make exact predictions about potential errors in the future. By anticipating future issues, the assembly line may take prompt preventative action, minimizing expensive downtime and increasing overall productivity.
### Dataset Description - 
The Dataset contains about 87,000 rows and involves the assembly line failure data from 01-04-2022 to 30-09-2022.It contains crucial information related to the tractor engine assembly line at Mahindra & Mahindra. It appears to be a log or record of events and incidents that occurred on specific dates at different stations along the assembly line. Each row in the dataset represents a unique event, and various attributes have been recorded for each event. Let's break down the dataset and its attributes to create a comprehensive description:
1. Date: The date on which the event occurred.
2. Station_Name: The name or identifier of the station along the tractor engine assembly line where the event took place.
3. Serial_No: The serial number associated with the tractor engine or its components involved in the event.
4. Stop_Time: The time at which the tractor engine assembly line stopped due to an event or issue.
5. Resume_Time: The time at which the tractor engine assembly line resumed operations after the stoppage.
6. Duration: The duration of the stoppage, which indicates the amount of time the assembly line was inactive.
7. ActualLineLoss: This attribute might represent a code or identifier associated with the specific type of line loss incurred during the event.
8. Line_Stop_By: ID of the employee who stopped the line.
9. Stop_Reason: The reason provided for why the assembly line was stopped.
10. Remarks: Additional comments or remarks related to the event.
### Methodology - 

1. Data Preprocessing
   1. Remove any duplicate rows from the dataset, if present.
   2. Handle missing values: If there are missing values, impute them using appropriate techniques, such as mean, median, or interpolation, depending on the nature of the data and the missing values.
   3. Convert date and time columns into appropriate formats, such as datetime objects, to facilitate time-based analysis.
   4. Encode categorical variables: If there are categorical attributes, convert them into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
2. Feature Engineering
  1. Extract relevant features from the existing attributes that could be useful for prediction. For example, you could create new features like "Time of Day" or "Day of the Week" from the timestamp data.
Consider incorporating additional external data if available, which might provide valuable insights into the tractor engine assembly process and potential causes of failures.
3. Data Splitting
  1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the LSTM model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
4. Sequence Preparation
   1. Since LSTM is designed to work with sequential data, we need to convert our dataset into sequences. Each sequence will represent a specific time window or period, and the LSTM model will learn patterns within these sequences to make predictions.
   2. Decide on the sequence length, which will determine the number of time steps the LSTM will consider as input to predict the next event.
5. Scaling
  1. Scale the numerical features to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1, using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling. This helps in faster convergence and better performance of the LSTM.
6. Model Architecture
  1. Design the LSTM architecture. Typically, an LSTM model will have one or more LSTM layers followed by fully connected (dense) layers for prediction.
  2. Experiment with the number of LSTM units and hidden layers to find an optimal architecture. You can also use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout layers.
7. Model Training
  1. Train the LSTM model on the training dataset. Use appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms (e.g., Mean Squared Error loss, Adam optimizer) for the task at hand.
  2. Use a batch size suitable for the dataset and the available computational resources.
  3. Monitor the training process to ensure that the model is not overfitting on the training data.
8. Model Evaluation
  1. Evaluate the trained LSTM model on the testing dataset to assess its predictive performance.
  2. Calculate relevant evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or any other domain-specific metric that aligns with the problem statement.
9. Hyperparameter Tuning
  1. Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and LSTM architecture parameters, to find the optimal combination that yields the best performance.
10. Prediction and Interpretation:
  1. Once the LSTM model is trained and evaluated, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
  2. Analyze the predictions and identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate potential failures or issues on the tractor engine assembly line.
  3. Interpret the model's outputs and insights to make informed decisions for preventive maintenance or process improvements.
11. Iterative Refinement
  1. Based on the performance of the LSTM model, iterate and fine-tune the preprocessing, feature engineering, and model architecture to improve prediction accuracy.
### LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) - 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to handle sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTM networks are explicitly designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing them to effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. LSTM has gained significant popularity in various applications, including natural language processing, time series analysis, speech recognition, and more. In our research, we propose utilizing LSTM to create a predictive model for anticipating problems in the tractor engine assembly line at Mahindra & Mahindra.
### Conclusion - 
In conclusion, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model offers a powerful solution for handling sequential data, making it an ideal choice for predicting potential problems in the tractor engine assembly line at Mahindra & Mahindra. Leveraging its ability to capture long-term dependencies, our LSTM-based predictive model is expected to enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve product quality by proactively identifying and addressing potential issues in the assembly process. By incorporating historical data on tractor engine failures and their causes, the LSTM model provides a promising approach for anticipating failures before they occur, contributing to more reliable and optimized assembly line operations.
